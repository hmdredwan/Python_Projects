    Type the target text as accurately and quickly as possible.
    Backspace is supported to correct mistakes.
    When finished, your WPM will be displayed, and you can press any key to continue.

Libraries:
    - curses: A library for creating text-based user interfaces.
    - time: Used for measuring time during the typing test.
    - random: To select a random target text from a file.

    - start_screen(stdscr): Displays the welcome screen and waits for user input to start.
    - display_text(stdscr, target, current, wpm): Displays the target text, current input, and WPM.
    - load_text(): Loads a random target text from a file named "text.txt".
    - wpm_test(stdscr): Handles the typing test and calculates WPM.
    - main(stdscr): Initializes curses and controls the flow of the program.

Instructions:
    1. Press any key to start the typing test.
    2. Type the target text as quickly and accurately as possible.
